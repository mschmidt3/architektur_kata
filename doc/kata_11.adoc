== 11. I'll Have the BLT

A national sandwich shop wants to enable 'fax in your order' but over the Internet instead (in addition to their current fax-in service)

*    Users: thousands, perhaps one day millions
*    Requirements:
**        users will place their order, then be given a time to pick up their sandwich and directions to the shop (which must integrate with several external mapping services that include traffic information)
**        if the shop offers a delivery service, dispatch the driver with the sandwich to the user
**        mobile-device accessibility
**        offer national daily promotionals/specials
**        offer local daily promotionals/specials
**        accept payment online or in person/on delivery
*    Additional Context:
**        Sandwich shops are franchised, each with a different owner.
**        Parent company has near-future plans to expand overseas.
**        Corporate goal is to hire inexpensive labor to maximize profit.
